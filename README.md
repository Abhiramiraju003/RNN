# Sentiment Analysis on Product Reviews using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

## Overview
This project implements a **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** for **sentiment analysis** on product reviews. The model is designed to classify customer reviews as **positive, negative, or neutral**, helping businesses analyze and understand customer sentiments effectively.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of product reviews collected from e-commerce platforms. Each review includes:
- **Review Text**: The actual customer feedback.
- **Sentiment Label**: Categorized as Positive (1), Negative (0), or Neutral (2).

### Preprocessing Steps:
1. Tokenization and text cleaning (removal of special characters, stopwords, etc.).
2. Converting text into sequences using **Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, or FastText)**.
3. Padding sequences to ensure uniform input length for the RNN model.

## Model Architecture
The RNN model consists of the following layers:
- **Embedding Layer**: Converts words into dense vectors.
- **Recurrent Layer**: Uses **Simple RNN**, **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**, or **GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)** to capture sequential dependencies in text.
- **Fully Connected Layer**: Processes the output from RNN layers.
- **Output Layer**: Uses a softmax activation function for multi-class classification (positive, negative, neutral).

### Hyperparameters:
- **Embedding Dimension**: 100-300
- **RNN Type**: Simple RNN / LSTM / GRU
- **Hidden Units**: 64-256
- **Dropout**: 0.2-0.5 (for regularization)
- **Optimizer**: Adam
- **Loss Function**: Categorical Crossentropy
- **Batch Size**: 32 or 64
- **Epochs**: 20-50

## Installation
To run this project, install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn tensorflow keras nltk
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/rnn-sentiment-analysis.git
cd rnn-sentiment-analysis
```
2. Run the preprocessing script:
```bash
python preprocess.py
```
3. Train the RNN model:
```bash
python train.py
```
4. Evaluate the model:
```bash
python evaluate.py
```
5. Make predictions on new reviews:
```bash
python predict.py "The product quality is excellent!"
```

## Results
- The model achieves an accuracy of **XX%** on the test set.
- Example predictions:
  - *"I love this product!" → Positive*
  - *"The quality is terrible." → Negative*

## Future Improvements
- Implementing **Bidirectional RNN or Transformer-based models** for enhanced accuracy.
- Hyperparameter tuning using **Grid Search or Bayesian Optimization**.
- Expanding the dataset with more diverse product categories.
